Fortis Healthcare Valuation & Business Analysis (FY23–FY30)

This project demonstrates my interest in business analytics, finance, and data-driven decision making, alongside my core background in Computer Science Engineering.

I built this end-to-end valuation model to understand how real-world companies are evaluated using financial data, assumptions, and structured analysis, rather than code alone.
